# ONLINE-_VOTING_SYSTEM
Online Voting System (HTML • CSS • JavaScript) — simple, client-side demo with voter login simulation, ballot UI, and results tallying.

# Online Voting System (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

**Simple client-side prototype of an online voting system** built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
This project is intended as a learning/demo app — it shows voter login simulation, ballot casting, client-side vote tallying and an audit-friendly design (with a mock paper trail). **Not production-ready** (no server-side security, no real authentication, not suitable for real elections).
